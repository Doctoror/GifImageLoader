##Description

GifImageLoader is a library based on Volley ImageLoader that enables the developer to load, show and cache animated gif images as well as static images.
GifImageView allows to display animated gifs (not currently working with scaleType="center" for some reason).

GifImageView has API just like a normal Volley NetworkImageView by calling setImageUrl() but also has the ability to set ImageInfo with Type.ANIMATED to load gifs.
